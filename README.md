# Reginald Dodd's Security Advisories
This is a database of security advisories from vulnerabilities that I have discovered and were made public.

I practice responsible disclosure so any vulnerabilities that are listed here were fixed by the vendor or they were contacted before the security advisory.

In most cases, these advisories can be found in security mailing lists, as well.

The most up to date list can be found on my blog: https://doddsecurity.com/published-vulnerabilities/
